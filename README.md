- **Booking System:** Reservation, check-in/out, and booking management.
- **Payment Processing:** Transaction handling for bookings.
- **Review System:** User-generated reviews and property ratings.
- **Data Optimization:** Efficient data access via indexing and caching.



## 🛠️ Features Overview

### 1. API Documentation
- **OpenAPI Standard:** All REST endpoints are documented for clarity and easy integration.
- **Django REST Framework:** Full CRUD APIs for users, properties, bookings, etc.
- **GraphQL Support:** Optional flexible querying for advanced frontend integration.

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints:** `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
- **Features:** Register, log in, and manage user profiles securely.

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints:** `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints:** `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features:** Book properties, view booking history, manage check-in/check-out.

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints:** `/payments/`
- **Features:** Handle transactions related to bookings securely.

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints:** `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
- **Features:** Post and manage user reviews for listed properties.

### 7. Database Optimizations
- **Indexing:** Applied to frequent queries for performance.
- **Caching:** Redis caching improves speed and reduces DB load.
