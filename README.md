## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features implemented in the backend and how each contributes to the overall functionality of the Airbnb Clone.

### 👥 User Management

Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile management. 
It ensures that both guests and hosts can securely access and manage their accounts with role-based controls.

### 🏘️ Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. 
This feature is central to the platform, enabling users to showcase available spaces with details like pricing, location, and amenities.

### 📆 Booking System

Manages the reservation process from check-in to check-out. 
Guests can book properties for specific dates, and the system prevents double-booking by enforcing date availability.

### 💳 Payment Processing

Facilitates secure transactions between guests and hosts. 
It handles booking-related payments, tracks payment status, and ensures transaction records are stored for reference.

### ⭐ Review System

Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve booked. 
This builds trust in the platform by providing user-generated feedback and helps hosts improve their offerings.

### ⚙️ Data Optimization

Uses techniques like database indexing and caching to improve performance and scalability. 
This ensures faster response times and reduces load during high-traffic operations.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical part of this backend project to protect sensitive user data, prevent misuse of the system, and ensure trust across the platform. The following measures will be implemented to secure the API and its data:

### 🔑 Authentication

All users must log in using secure authentication methods such as token-based or JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.  
This ensures that only verified users can access protected endpoints and interact with their own data securely.

### 🛡️ Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to restrict access to certain resources.  
For example, only hosts can create or manage property listings, while only the user who made a booking can cancel or view its details.  
This prevents unauthorized actions and maintains data integrity across user roles.

### 🚦 Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and DDoS attacks, rate limiting is applied to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a given timeframe.  
This helps protect server resources and improves overall stability of the application.

### 🧪 Input Validation & Sanitization

All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or XSS (Cross-site Scripting).  
This helps ensure that only safe, expected data reaches the database or is rendered in responses.

### 🔒 HTTPS Enforcement (In Deployment)

The API will be served over HTTPS in production environments to ensure encrypted communication between clients and servers.  
This protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and keeps sensitive information like passwords and payment data secure.

### 💳 Payment Security

All payment data is handled through a secure third-party payment gateway.  
This ensures compliance with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS) and keeps financial data isolated from the backend application, reducing liability and improving security posture.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code. It helps ensure that changes pushed to the codebase are reliable, consistent, and production-ready.

### Why It's Important

- 🧪 **Automatic Testing** – Runs tests on every commit to catch bugs early.
- 🔁 **Consistent Builds** – Ensures the app behaves the same across development, staging, and production environments.
- 🚀 **Faster Delivery** – New features, fixes, or updates can be shipped quickly and safely without manual intervention.
- 🔒 **Reduces Human Error** – Eliminates manual steps in testing and deployment.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions** – For automating workflows like running tests, building Docker images, and deploying on push or PR.
- **Docker** – Ensures consistency across environments by packaging the app and dependencies together.
- **(Optional)** **Heroku / AWS / Railway / Render** – Can be used for automatic deployment once the pipeline passes.
