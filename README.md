# Airbnb Clone – Backend

## 🌍 Overview

This is the backend for an Airbnb Clone project. It provides a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payment processing. Built with Django and Django REST Framework, it aims to mimic core Airbnb functionalities.



## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management:** Secure registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management:** Creation, updating, and retrieval of property listings.
- **Booking System:** Reservation, check-in/out, and booking management.
- **Payment Processing:** Transaction handling for bookings.
- **Review System:** User-generated reviews and property ratings.
- **Data Optimization:** Efficient data access via indexing and caching.



## 🛠️ Features Overview

### 1. API Documentation
- **OpenAPI Standard:** All REST endpoints are documented for clarity and easy integration.
- **Django REST Framework:** Full CRUD APIs for users, properties, bookings, etc.
- **GraphQL Support:** Optional flexible querying for advanced frontend integration.

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints:** `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
- **Features:** Register, log in, and manage user profiles securely.

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints:** `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints:** `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features:** Book properties, view booking history, manage check-in/check-out.

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints:** `/payments/`
- **Features:** Handle transactions related to bookings securely.

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints:** `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
- **Features:** Post and manage user reviews for listed properties.

### 7. Database Optimizations
- **Indexing:** Applied to frequent queries for performance.
- **Caching:** Redis caching improves speed and reduces DB load.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

A breakdown of the technologies used in building this backend system:

- 🐍 **Django**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build robust backend logic and manage the overall application structure.

- 🧰 **Django REST Framework (DRF)**  
  Provides tools for building flexible and powerful RESTful APIs to handle user, property, booking, and payment operations.

- 🔍 **GraphQL**  
  Enables efficient, flexible querying from the frontend, reducing over-fetching of data and allowing custom queries.

- 🛢️ **PostgreSQL**  
  A reliable, scalable relational database used for storing and querying structured data like users, bookings, and properties.

- 📬 **Celery**  
  Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications, email confirmations, and processing background jobs.

- ⚡ **Redis**  
  Used alongside Celery for task queuing and also serves as a caching layer to boost performance.

- 🐳 **Docker**  
  Containerizes the application and its dependencies to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

- 🔁 **CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Automates testing and deployment processes to ensure rapid and reliable updates to the application.
